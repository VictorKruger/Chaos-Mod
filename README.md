Fork of Chaos Mod.
Current version of Mod has an event, Deathcoin, that hard locks the game.  I by no means am an expert in fixing the issue so I just figured out how to remove the event from the chance table.
I also severely reduced the chances that Chica's Feeding Frenzy and Balloon Boy world from happening from 1.0 to .00002 in table.

This is the FNAF Security Breach Chaos Mod, which is chaos at it's purest form.
